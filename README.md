## Design

### Colour Scheme

- Consistency was maintained in the color scheme across all screens, with the primary background color being #e8f5e9. This choice was made as the light green color gives excellent readability for black text and gives a calm, fresh appearance to the site. The dark blue of the nav bar, #1e3a5f, compliments this background color well and looks quite stark against it. The most important element in considering the design of this site is that it is simple, clear and straightfoward to navigate. 



### Fonts

- Google Fonts were  integrated into the website, with Lora as the primary font, accompanied by a sans-serif fallback for optimal readability across all screens. To inject a stylish but playful touch, Pacifico was selected for the headings, this font pairs nicely with Lato. 

### Structure

- The website structure has been designed for user-friendliness, emphasizing easy navigation. Key components of the game include:
 
  1.  Home Page / Pub Directory: 
      - Title: Dog Friendly Pubs in Anglesey - provides context for the directory and lets the user know immediately if the content is for them or not. 
      - displays all the Pubs listed in the directory using cards that display a photo of the pub, pub name, pub location and the average rating of the pub. Clicking on the reveal button displays a description of the pub alongside all the pub reviews. Users are here invited to elave their own reviews. 
      - icons at the very bottom of the card lets users know whether the pub serves food, whether dogs are allowed inside, is water provided for dogs, are meals offered for dogs, is there beautiful walks nearby and, finally, whether the staff were friendly. These aspects were focused on as research revealed that these are the most important consideration for those that like to include their dogs on adventures. 
      

  2.  login Page:

      - Short explaination for user that instructs them of the need to log in to be able to leave a review or add a pub. 
      - hyper link that user can click and be redirected to if they dont already have an account and need to register.
      - username and password input boxes. 
      - show password clickbox that can be toggled to reveal the inputted password. 

  3. Registration page: 
      - Reveals congratulations message alongside a philosophical quote. 
      - Features background image of euripides in the bath shouting eureka. 
      - Displays scoreboard showing total number of correct guesses.
      - This screen also features convenient options with a "Play Another Round" button and a "Quit" button for seamless navigation and user control.

      The above three pages are displayed regardless of whether or not the user has created an account. Logging in reveals the follwing additional pages. 

   4. Profile Page:   
      - brief flash message saying welcome back
      - Displays the users reviews with edit and delete buttons allowing for changes and permenant deletion if necessary 
      - Displays the pubs added by the user with edit and delete buttons allowing for changes and permenant deletion if necessary 

   5. Add Pub Page: 
      - reveals a basic form that asks user to fill in various details about the pub (name, location, description). Questions are then asked using check boxes, these then correspond to the icons that are displayed on the cards (meals served, dogs allowed inside, water provided, dog meals offered, beautiful walks nearby and friendly staff).
      - clicking on the add pub button then takes the user to a page where they can either upload a photo of the pub or continue without uploading an image. If an image isnt chosen, a default image of a beautiful whippet will be used so as there is always an image of some sorts with the pub information, maintaining the site design aesthetic. 
  
   6. Logout Page:
      - clicking on this logs the user out. A brief flash message is displayed letting the user know they have been logged out displays the login page, should the user then want to log back in again. 

      The following page is only for the administrator. Username: admin / password: bunnyrabbit. This allows the administrator full control of all the content of the website. 

   7. Manage reviews: 
      - this is essentially a duplicate of the homepage that displays all the pubs in the directory except there is a delete button on each and every one of the cards that allows admin to delete individual pubs. 
      - delete buttons are also utilised on all reviews associated with each pub, again allowing admin to delete individual reviews. 
      - so as content is not deleted by accident a confirm delete button is always displayed asking for confirmation of intent.

<details><summary>game.js</summary><img src="docs/jsHint.png"></details>

### Accessibility

The WAVE WebAIM accessibility evaluation tool was utilized to ensure compliance with accessibility standards. No errors were identified, affirming the website's accessibility. An alert was identified, suggesting that the hidden word might be mistakenly perceived as a header. To enhance accessibility, an ARIA role of "text" and an ARIA level of "0" were implemented, ensuring that the hidden word is explicitly recognized as non-header content. However, the evaulation tool contiuned to flag the alert, therefore I changed from div to a h3 element to resolve the issue.

### Performance

Google Lighthouse within Google Chrome Developer Tools served as the performance testing tool for the website, providing insights into various aspects such as performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. The performance scores for desktop mode were consistently excellent across all testing parameters. However, during mobile testing, the performance score registered at 63. In an effort to enhance this score, all image files underwent resizing, compression, and conversion to webp format. Additionally, to further boost performance, the CSS was minified. The combined effect of these two measures resulted in an improved performance score of 84.

| Initial rendering of reviews.html failed with a cursor object error.  | The problem arose from using 'reviews.pub_name' to access database information. However, 'reviews' represents the entire cursor object retrieved from MongoDB, while 'pub_name' is an attribute of each individual document (review) within the cursor. Changing 'reviews' to 'review' in the iteration loop resolved the error.   | 

 Side navbar mobile function not working, 404 error on js file being returned  | A simple typo had caused this error, the Javascript folder had been named 'jss'. Correcting it to 'js', resolved the issue and the scripts.js file was able to be located and executed    | 



Encountered a type error while attempting to implement a visual star rating system based on the users rating.   | The issue stemmed from comparing a string to an integer, resulting in a TypeError. Resolution involved converting the rating to an integer using the int() function before comparison, thereby rectifying the issue."   | 

Resolved an issue where the food bowl icon failed to display in the review card main panel.  | The problem stemmed from a typo in the MongoDB naming pairs, where 'dog_meals=True' was incorrectly written as 'dog_meals=:True'. By removing the erroneous '=', the fontawesome food bowl icon now displays correctly.  | 

After implementing a for loop in the get_pubs application to fetch and render reviews associated with pub IDs, only pubs were displayed on the homepage without any reviews |   To address this, debugging statements were integrated into the route function, revealing that although both pubs and reviews were retrieved from the database, there were no reviews associated with pub IDs. A thorough examination of the MongoDB collections highlighted a data type discrepancy: the reviews collection utilized "pub_id" as a string, while the pubs collection employed ObjectId. This mismatch prevented proper association between pubs and reviews.

Resolution: To resolve the issue, code was added to convert ObjectId to a string format when retrieving data from the pubs collection. This adjustment ensured compatibility between the pub IDs in both collections, enabling accurate linkage between pubs and their associated reviews. With the data type mismatch rectified, the reviews were successfully associated with the corresponding pubs, allowing them to be displayed on the homepage as intended.   | 

Issue around displaying user_rating within the reviews visually as stars, despite converting to integers within the write_review route there was still a type error being displayed.  |  It appears that the issue is not with the conversion of user_rating to an integer in the route function but rather with how it's being used in the template. The error message indicated that a string object cannot be interpreted as an integer, which suggests that user_rating is still a string when it's being used in the template. Further investigation revealed that the error specifically occured on the line where user_rating was being used in the range function.
This was resolved by adding |int after review.user_rating, which ensured that user_rating was intepreted as an integer before being used in the range function.   | 


After creating the Flask route for editing reviews, an issue arose where the edit_review.html template failed to render. No error messages were displayed, and upon introducing print statements to the route for debugging, it became apparent that the route wasn't being called at all.Further investigation revealed a simple error in the edit_review.html template. The "Edit" button was not enclosed within a form element, preventing the GET request to the edit_review URL from being sent.   | Correcting this oversight by ensuring the "Edit" button was appropriately placed within a form element with the method set to "GET" enabled the Flask route to handle the GET request effectively, resulting in the expected rendering of the edit_review.html template
