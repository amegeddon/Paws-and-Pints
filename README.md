#### Database Structure

For this dog-friendly pub review site, I've opted to use MongoDB for its non-relational database capabilities. This choice supports dynamic inputs across collections, facilitating diverse data storage such as user reviews, pub details, and photos.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

- Consistency was maintained in the color scheme across all screens, with the primary background color being #e8f5e9. This choice was made as the light green color gives excellent readability for black text and gives a calm, fresh appearance to the site. The dark blue of the nav bar, #1e3a5f, compliments this background color well and looks quite stark against it. The most important element in considering the design of this site is that it is simple, clear and straightfoward to navigate. 



### Fonts

- Google Fonts were  integrated into the website, with Lora as the primary font, accompanied by a sans-serif fallback for optimal readability across all screens. To inject a stylish but playful touch, Pacifico was selected for the headings, this font pairs nicely with Lato.

## Features

### NavBar 

The top navigation bar includes the site name and adapts its links based on the user's login status. On smaller screens, the navbar collapses into a sidebar.

For non-logged-in users, links to the home, sign-in, and register pages are available. Once logged in, users gain access to their personal profile, the option to add new pubs, and the ability to write reviews.

<details><summary>Nav sidebar</summary>

</details>

### Home screen

- Title: Dog Friendly Pubs in Anglesey - provides context for the directory and lets the user know immediately if the content is for them or not. 
 - displays all the Pubs listed in the directory using cards that display a photo of the pub, pub name, pub location and the average rating of the pub. Clicking on the reveal button displays a description of the pub alongside all the pub reviews. Users are here invited to leave their own reviews. 
- icons at the very bottom of the card lets users know whether the pub serves food, whether dogs are allowed inside, is water provided for dogs, are meals offered for dogs, is there beautiful walks nearby and, finally, whether the staff were friendly. These aspects were focused on as research revealed that these are the most important consideration for those that like to include their dogs on adventures. 
- Visual feedback on the pub's rating is provided through an average rating, represented by colored stars corresponding to the average rating

## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming is implemented in order to ensure secure access control. Conditional checks verify user permissions, ensuring only admins can edit any user's posts or access admin areas. For regular users, they can only edit their own posts. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page.

Specifically, the profile route includes several security measures:

Session Check: If session["user"] is not set, the user is redirected to the login page.
Session Username Validation: The session username is retrieved from the database to confirm it matches the current session’s username.

URL Username Match: It ensures the session username matches the username in the URL. If they don’t match, access is denied, a flash message reads 'You need to be logged in to view this page' and the user is redirected to the login page.

These checks prevent unauthorized access and ensure that users can only access their own profiles.

</details>

## Future Implementations

- Enabling users to upload their own images and store them in MongoDB was a challenging task. This function requires more defensive programming to ensure robustness, and further research is needed to evaluate the scalability of storing images in this manner, as it may become problematic in the future. Additionally, when a pub is deleted from the database, the corresponding image is not being removed. If I had more time, addressing this issue would be a priority, as it contributes to unnecessary storage strain. One potential solution is to incorporate a function into the photo upload route that reduces image size, which could help conserve storage space.

- A sort-by function that arranges pubs by highest average reviews would be beneficial as the site grows in the number of pubs and reviews. This feature would enhance user experience by allowing visitors to easily find the most highly-rated pubs.

- The search bar is functional but lacks polish; search results do not appear at the top of the page but remain in their original positions, creating a disorganized appearance. Despite various attempts to fix this issue, it remains unresolved. Addressing this problem will be crucial as the number of pub entries increases, as users currently need to scroll past empty space to find their search results. This area definitely needs improvement in the future.

## Deployment & Local Development

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the Non-Relational Database.

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign-up on their site, then follow these steps:

- The name of the database on MongoDB should be called "__pub_reviews__".
- The collection(s) needed for this database should be "__photos__", "__pubs__",__users__ and "__reviews__.
- Click on the __pub_reviews__ name created for the project.
- Click on the __Connect__ button.
- Click __Connect Your Application__.
- Copy the connection string, and replace `password` with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select __New__ in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select __Create new app__ from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select __Create App__.
- From the new app __Settings__, click __Reveal Config Vars__, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's __requirements__ (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace __app.py__ with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

NOTE: The Procfile uses a capital P and doesn't have a file extension on the end.

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select __Automatic Deployment__ from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
