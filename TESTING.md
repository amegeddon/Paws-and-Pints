## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

The HTML on all pages of the site was validated using the W3C validator, and the CSS was also validated through the same tool. The HTML was checked by inputting the URL of the deployed site to avoid errors related to Jinja templating, while the CSS was validated via direct input.

<details><summary>Index HTML</summary>
<img src="static/images/html-home.png">

<details><summary>Register HTML</summary>

>Note:
> The 404 page was manually tested by inputting the code directly into the validator and no errors were found except for those related to the Jinja templating.

### Javascript Validation

[JS Hint](https://jshint.com) The JavaScript on the site was tested and no major errors were found. However, some warnings for undefined and an unused variable were flagged. The undefined variable warnings stem from code copied from Materialize, and all variables are used within HTML files.

<details><summary>Vanilla Javascript</summary>

### Python Validation

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) has been utilized to validate Python code on the site, ensuring it complies with PEP 8 standards. Initially, this highlighted numerous whitespace errors, but these have been resolved, and the current code is now PEP 8 compliant.

### Lighthouse

The Lighthouse tool in Chrome Developer Tools has been used to test performance, best practices, accessibility, and SEO. Both desktop and mobile tests have been conducted for each page.

> Notes for Lighthouse Testing:

>* The accessibility score is lower on the admin's Manage Reviews page due to the delete button. This button uses Materialize classes, and despite efforts, it has not been possible to adjust the red background and white text enough to provide sufficient contrast.
>
>* Performance scores on mobile devices can be improved by reducing image sizes. This can be achieved by adding a function to the photo upload Flask route that automatically resizes images upon upload.

### WAVE Testing

Testing with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org) has identified issues with the img alt tags, indicating they are duplicate and potentially insufficient. To improve accessibility, users should be able to provide their own descriptive alt text. The default "user uploaded image" is not adequate.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial rendering of reviews.html failed with a cursor object error.  | The problem arose from using 'reviews.pub_name' to access database information. However, 'reviews' represents the entire cursor object retrieved from MongoDB, while 'pub_name' is an attribute of each individual document (review) within the cursor. Changing 'reviews' to 'review' in the iteration loop resolved the error.   | 

 Side navbar mobile function not working, 404 error on js file being returned  | A simple typo had caused this error, the Javascript folder had been named 'jss'. Correcting it to 'js', resolved the issue and the scripts.js file was able to be located and executed    | 



Encountered a type error while attempting to implement a visual star rating system based on the users rating.   | The issue stemmed from comparing a string to an integer, resulting in a TypeError. Resolution involved converting the rating to an integer using the int() function before comparison, thereby rectifying the issue."   | 

Resolved an issue where the food bowl icon failed to display in the review card main panel.  | The problem stemmed from a typo in the MongoDB naming pairs, where 'dog_meals=True' was incorrectly written as 'dog_meals=:True'. By removing the erroneous '=', the fontawesome food bowl icon now displays correctly.  | 

After implementing a for loop in the get_pubs application to fetch and render reviews associated with pub IDs, only pubs were displayed on the homepage without any reviews |   To address this, debugging statements were integrated into the route function, revealing that although both pubs and reviews were retrieved from the database, there were no reviews associated with pub IDs. A thorough examination of the MongoDB collections highlighted a data type discrepancy: the reviews collection utilized "pub_id" as a string, while the pubs collection employed ObjectId. This mismatch prevented proper association between pubs and reviews.

Resolution: To resolve the issue, code was added to convert ObjectId to a string format when retrieving data from the pubs collection. This adjustment ensured compatibility between the pub IDs in both collections, enabling accurate linkage between pubs and their associated reviews. With the data type mismatch rectified, the reviews were successfully associated with the corresponding pubs, allowing them to be displayed on the homepage as intended.   | 

Issue around displaying user_rating within the reviews visually as stars, despite converting to integers within the write_review route there was still a type error being displayed.  |  It appears that the issue is not with the conversion of user_rating to an integer in the route function but rather with how it's being used in the template. The error message indicated that a string object cannot be interpreted as an integer, which suggests that user_rating is still a string when it's being used in the template. Further investigation revealed that the error specifically occured on the line where user_rating was being used in the range function.
This was resolved by adding |int after review.user_rating, which ensured that user_rating was intepreted as an integer before being used in the range function.   | 


After creating the Flask route for editing reviews, an issue arose where the edit_review.html template failed to render. No error messages were displayed, and upon introducing print statements to the route for debugging, it became apparent that the route wasn't being called at all.Further investigation revealed a simple error in the edit_review.html template. The "Edit" button was not enclosed within a form element, preventing the GET request to the edit_review URL from being sent.   | Correcting this oversight by ensuring the "Edit" button was appropriately placed within a form element with the method set to "GET" enabled the Flask route to handle the GET request effectively, resulting in the expected rendering of the edit_review.html template

| Search Results Display Unpredictably | Despite various attempts to style the search results with CSS, they do not consistently appear at the top of the page as expected. Further investigation is needed to determine if the issue is related to the use of Materialize for card layouts. |

| Database Photos Not Deleted with Pubs | Photos stored in the database are not being removed when corresponding pubs are deleted, leading to increased storage use. This issue needs urgent attention. The current approach, which stores images as binary data, raises scalability concerns. Storing images separately via URLs could be a more efficient solution. The fact that images remain in the database even after the related pubs are deleted is not sustainable. |
