- The background color for the heading, #e5d6c2, was deliberately selected for its ability to complement the vibrant orange whilst also maintaining a good contrast with the black text color for readability.

### Fonts

- Google Fonts were  integrated into the website, with Lato as the primary font, accompanied by a sans-serif fallback for optimal readability across all screens. To inject a stylish but playful touch, Poiret One with its art deco easthetic was selected for the game title and headings, this font pairs nicely with Lato.

## Validation

### HTML Validation

The website's HTML was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service, with all pages passing without errors.

### CSS Validation

The W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service was used to validate the CSS of the website. Upon validation

</details>

### JavaScript Validation

JavaScript files were validated using the JSHint JS Validation Service, revealing no significant issues.

<details><summary>game.js</summary><img src="docs/jsHint.png"></details>

### Accessibility

The WAVE WebAIM accessibility evaluation tool was utilized to ensure compliance with accessibility standards. No errors were identified, affirming the website's accessibility. An alert was identified, suggesting that the hidden word might be mistakenly perceived as a header. To enhance accessibility, an ARIA role of "text" and an ARIA level of "0" were implemented, ensuring that the hidden word is explicitly recognized as non-header content. However, the evaulation tool contiuned to flag the alert, therefore I changed from div to a h3 element to resolve the issue.

### Performance

Google Lighthouse within Google Chrome Developer Tools served as the performance testing tool for the website, providing insights into various aspects such as performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. The performance scores for desktop mode were consistently excellent across all testing parameters. However, during mobile testing, the performance score registered at 63. In an effort to enhance this score, all image files underwent resizing, compression, and conversion to webp format. Additionally, to further boost performance, the CSS was minified. The combined effect of these two measures resulted in an improved performance score of 84.

## Bugs

| Bug                                                                                                                                         | Fix                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial rendering of reviews.html failed with a cursor object error.  | The problem arose from using 'reviews.pub_name' to access database information. However, 'reviews' represents the entire cursor object retrieved from MongoDB, while 'pub_name' is an attribute of each individual document (review) within the cursor. Changing 'reviews' to 'review' in the iteration loop resolved the error.   | 

 Side navbar mobile function not working, 404 error on js file being returned  | A simple typo had caused this error, the Javascript folder had been named 'jss'. Correcting it to 'js', resolved the issue and the scripts.js file was able to be located and executed    | 



Encountered a type error while attempting to implement a visual star rating system based on the users rating.   | The issue stemmed from comparing a string to an integer, resulting in a TypeError. Resolution involved converting the rating to an integer using the int() function before comparison, thereby rectifying the issue."   | 

Resolved an issue where the food bowl icon failed to display in the review card main panel.  | The problem stemmed from a typo in the MongoDB naming pairs, where 'dog_meals=True' was incorrectly written as 'dog_meals=:True'. By removing the erroneous '=', the fontawesome food bowl icon now displays correctly.  | 

After implementing a for loop in the get_pubs application to fetch and render reviews associated with pub IDs, only pubs were displayed on the homepage without any reviews |   To address this, debugging statements were integrated into the route function, revealing that although both pubs and reviews were retrieved from the database, there were no reviews associated with pub IDs. A thorough examination of the MongoDB collections highlighted a data type discrepancy: the reviews collection utilized "pub_id" as a string, while the pubs collection employed ObjectId. This mismatch prevented proper association between pubs and reviews.

Resolution: To resolve the issue, code was added to convert ObjectId to a string format when retrieving data from the pubs collection. This adjustment ensured compatibility between the pub IDs in both collections, enabling accurate linkage between pubs and their associated reviews. With the data type mismatch rectified, the reviews were successfully associated with the corresponding pubs, allowing them to be displayed on the homepage as intended.   |

Thanks in plentiful supply for everyone who has put up with me cursing javascript. 

- to my mentor Richard for reminding me at every mentor meeting that Javascript is brilliant
- and to everyone else that I have hounded into playing the game and giving me feedback
- finally, thanks to the slack community for their encouragement and advice.
