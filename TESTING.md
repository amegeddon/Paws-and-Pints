## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

The HTML on all pages of the site was validated using the W3C validator, and the CSS was also validated through the same tool. The HTML was checked by inputting the URL of the deployed site to avoid errors related to Jinja templating, while the CSS was validated via direct input.

<details><summary>Index HTML</summary>
<img src="static/images/html-home.png">

<details><summary>Register HTML</summary>

>Note:
> The 404 page was manually tested by inputting the code directly into the validator and no errors were found except for those related to the Jinja templating.

### Javascript Validation

[JS Hint](https://jshint.com) The JavaScript on the site was tested and no major errors were found. However, some warnings for undefined and an unused variable were flagged. The undefined variable warnings stem from code copied from Materialize, and all variables are used within HTML files.

<details><summary>Vanilla Javascript</summary>

### Python Validation

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) has been utilized to validate Python code on the site, ensuring it complies with PEP 8 standards. Initially, this highlighted numerous whitespace errors, but these have been resolved, and the current code is now PEP 8 compliant.

### Lighthouse

The Lighthouse tool in Chrome Developer Tools has been used to test performance, best practices, accessibility, and SEO. Both desktop and mobile tests have been conducted for each page.

> Notes for Lighthouse Testing:

>* The accessibility score is lower on the admin's Manage Reviews page due to the delete button. This button uses Materialize classes, and despite efforts, it has not been possible to adjust the red background and white text enough to provide sufficient contrast.
>
>* Performance scores on mobile devices can be improved by reducing image sizes. This can be achieved by adding a function to the photo upload Flask route that automatically resizes images upon upload.

### WAVE Testing

Testing with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org) has identified issues with the img alt tags, indicating they are duplicate and potentially insufficient. To improve accessibility, users should be able to provide their own descriptive alt text. The default "user uploaded image" is not adequate.

### Solved Bugs

| Bug                                                                                                                                         | Fix                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial rendering of `reviews.html` failed with a cursor object error.  | The issue was caused by using `reviews.pub_name` to access database information. Since `reviews` represents the entire cursor object from MongoDB, and `pub_name` is an attribute of each individual review document, changing `reviews` to `review` in the iteration loop resolved the error. |
| Side navbar mobile function not working; 404 error on JS file being returned  | A typo in the folder name caused the issue. The folder was incorrectly named `jss` instead of `js`. Renaming it to `js` allowed the `scripts.js` file to be located and executed correctly. |
| Encountered a type error while implementing a visual star rating system based on user ratings.   | The error occurred due to comparing a string to an integer. The solution was to convert the rating to an integer using the `int()` function before comparison. |
| Resolved an issue where the food bowl icon failed to display in the review card main panel.  | The issue was due to a typo in MongoDB naming pairs: `dog_meals=True` was incorrectly written as `dog_meals=:True`. Removing the erroneous `=` corrected the display of the FontAwesome food bowl icon. |
| Issue with displaying reviews associated with pub IDs on the homepage. | Although both pubs and reviews were retrieved from the database, no reviews were associated with pub IDs due to a data type mismatch: the reviews collection used `"pub_id"` as a string, while the pubs collection used `ObjectId`. Adding code to convert `ObjectId` to a string format resolved the issue, enabling accurate linkage between pubs and reviews. |
| Issue with displaying `user_rating` visually as stars. Despite converting to integers within the `write_review` route, a type error was still present. | The problem was not with converting `user_rating` to an integer but with its usage in the template. The error message indicated that a string object could not be interpreted as an integer. Adding `|int` after `review.user_rating` in the template ensured that `user_rating` was treated as an integer before being used in the `range` function. |
| Issue with the `edit_review.html` template failing to render. | The issue was due to the "Edit" button not being enclosed within a form element, preventing the GET request from being sent. Placing the "Edit" button within a form element with the method set to "GET" resolved the issue, allowing the Flask route to handle the request and render the template correctly. |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Search Results Display Unpredictably | Despite various attempts to style the search results with CSS, they do not consistently appear at the top of the page as expected. Further investigation is needed to determine if the issue is related to the use of Materialize for card layouts. |
| Database Photos Not Deleted with Pubs | Photos stored in the database are not being removed when corresponding pubs are deleted, leading to increased storage use. This issue needs urgent attention. The current approach, which stores images as binary data, raises scalability concerns. Storing images separately via URLs could be a more efficient solution. The fact that images remain in the database even after the related pubs are deleted is not sustainable. |
