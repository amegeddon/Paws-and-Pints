## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

The HTML on all pages of the site was validated using the W3C validator, and the CSS was also validated through the same tool. The HTML was checked by inputting the URL of the deployed site to avoid errors related to Jinja templating, while the CSS was validated via direct input.

<details><summary>Index HTML</summary>

### Javascript Validation

[JS Hint](https://jshint.com) has been used to test the vanilla javascript on the site. This flagged no major errors, but there were some warnings for undefined and unused variables. Both undefined variable errors are from code that has been copied from Materialize and all variables have been used within HTML files.

### Python Validation

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) has been used to validate all python code on the site and ensure it is pep8 compliant. This has flagged no errors with the current code.

### Lighthouse

The lighthouse tool within the chrome developer tools has been used to test performance, best practices, accessibility, and SEO. Desktop and mobile tests have been run for each page.

> Notes for Lighthouse Testing:
>
>* Best practices has been pulled down to 96 across the site due to the site logo being in png. The logo was originally converted to webp but presented issues with rendering correctly and therefore has been left as it for the time being. Future versions of the site may either find a fix for the formatting issue, or a new logo.
>
>* Accessibility score is pulled down on all pages with forms due to poor contrast on form labels using materialize's default form styling. Further exploration with styling frameworks may be required.
>
>* Performance and best practices is pulled down on all pages with images that have been uploaded to the site via url upload. Future versions of the site look to implement image file uploads and compare performance with current results.

### WAVE Testing

Parts of the site have been tested for accessibility with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org), however, areas of the site that require log in details would return the log in page only. The index, register, and log in pages returned no errors, but picked up the same contrasting issues on the materialize form labels as lighthouse.

### Accessibility Testing

Accessibility has been tested via narrator for windows and talkback on android. This has highlighted issues with focusing on the floating action button on mobile. Alternative hidden nav links have been added to the navbar for editing profile and adding posts to enable talkback users to access the site fully without impacting the original styling of the site until a solution can be found.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

| # | Issue | Details | What was done | Fixed? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Unlike Post icons on profile not rendering | When viewing the liked posts collapsible on the profile page, the icons for removing the posts would not appear on the page | Removed "{% if post._id\|string in session["liked] %}" from above the icons. This would have been redundant code as the post has to be liked in order for it to be viewed on the profile. | __YES__ |
| 2 | Upload image files | The site was originally going to allow users to upload image files to use for their profile page. The functionality appeared to work but the image would not render on the page. |  This has now been moved to the future features section to be explored later. | __REMOVED__ |
| 3 | Searching by post title | When using the search bar on the community page, posts were not being found when a search was conducted for specific post titles | The issue seemed to resolve itself after a day. | __???__ |

<sup><sub>[*Back to top*](#contents)</sup></sub>

-----

### Known Bugs

| # | Issue | Details | Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Like post icons | When liking posts on the community page the icon changes and the like count goes up, however, if a user leaves the site and returns the like post icons return to unliked status until the user likes another post. The like count remains correct. This appears to be a random occurance that does not happen every time. | This issue may be linked to the solved issue of rendering unlike icons on the profile page. The next steps in addressing this is to explore possible alternatives to the if statement within the jinja templating and test for any caching issues in the browser. |
| 2 | Floating action buttons can not be focused on in talkback | When testing accessibility features on mobile, it was brought to my attention that the floating action buttons could not be focused on by the talkback feature. Hidden navbar links have been added to enable users to access the add post and edit profile pages but further refactoring is needed to ensure full functionality with the use of accessibility tools. | Conduct further research into floating action buttons and accessibility issues and explore alternative layouts to ensure full accessibility. |
